1. FSM
2. Random and probability
3. Sensors (Yard, First Floor)
4. Flocking
5. Pathfollowing (Yard->fixed paths, First floor->changing paths)
6. Obstacle avoidance (Yard)
7. Pathfinding A Star (First floor)
8. Navigation mesh
9. Behavior Trees

Second floor
- Blend using FLOCK of robots
- NPC use FSM to behave
- random and probability in decision making, to switch states in FSM
- Use navigation mesh to move
